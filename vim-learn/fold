'foldlevel' 'fdl'       number (default: 0)
                        local to window
                        {not in Vi}
                        {not available when compiled without the +folding
                        feature}
        Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
        Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will
        close fewer folds.
        This option is set by commands like zm, zM and zR.
        See fold-foldlevel.
        zm              Fold more: Subtract v:count1 from 'foldlevel'.  If 'foldlevel' was
                already zero nothing happens.
        zr              Reduce folding: Add v:count1 to 'foldlevel'.
